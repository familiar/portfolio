                hey, i'm ethan. 
                -> i like building cool stuff for content creators.
                <br>
                over the years, i've worked on tons of projects and built many things.
                <br>
                when i was 13, i started a minecraft youtube channel.
                <br>
                that summer at 14, i got offered a brand deal with a small company. 
                -> you might have heard of it before, it's called lunar client.
                <br>
                shortly after, at 15, minecraft and digital-media made me 5-figures.
                <br>
                at 16, i shifted perspectives.
                -> built ~7 different projects including research + startups. 
                -> learned some cool stuff, benefitted from the experience, and failed.
                <br>
                17 is when i got into UCLA for computer science, with a 1200 SAT score.
                -> got rejected from 15/17 colleges. 
                -> wrote about minecraft, made a documentary.
                <br>
                now, at 18, i'm busy co-founding a startup.
                -> it's called Out.so.
                -> i built it with a friend i met cheating on minecraft 5 years ago. 
                -> we've been working on it for a year, and we've grown to 2.5K+ creators.
                <br>
                who knows what's next? 
                want to build something crazy? hit me.
