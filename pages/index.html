        <br>
        <p class="paratex">over the years, i've worked on tons of projects and built many things:</p>
        <br>
        <p class="paratex">when i was 13, i started a minecraft youtube channel.</p>
        <p class="paratex">that summer at 14, i got offered a brand deal with a small company in the minecraft niche. you might have heard of it before, it's called lunar client.</p>
        <p class="paratex">shortly after, at 15, minecraft and digital-media netted me 5-figure revenue.</p>
        <p class="paratex">at 16, i shifted perspectives. built ~7 different projects including research + startups. learned some cool stuff, benefitted from the experience, and failed alot.</p>
        <p class="paratex">17 is when i got into UCLA for computer science, with a 1200 SAT score and rejections from 15/17 colleges. wrote about minecraft, made a documentary.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="paratex">now, at 18, i'm busy co-founding a startup called Out.so with a friend i met cheating on minecraft 5 years ago. we've been working on it for a year, and we've grown to thousands of users.</p>
